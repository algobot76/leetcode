# Problems 951 - 1000

## 973. K Closest Points to Origin

[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

### Priority Queue

Python:

<<< @/leetcode-python/leetcode/973_k_closest_points_to_origin/solution1.py

::: tip Notes

_Time_: `O(nlogk)`

_Space_: `O(logk)`

---

- Use a priority queue to store the points.
- Note that `heapq` uses min heap by default, so you have to convert the numbers (`dist`, `point[0]`. `point[1]`) to negative numbers.
- Don't forget to convert the negative numbers back to positive at the end.
