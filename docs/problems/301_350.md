# Problems 301 - 350

## 346. Moving Average from Data Stream

[Problem description](https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/)

__Python__:

<<< @/leetcode-python/leetcode/346_moving_average_from_data_stream/solution1.py

::: tip Notes

_Time_: `O(1)`

_Space_: `O(k)`

---

- Use a `deque` instead of a list because `deque`'s appends and pops have complexity of `O(1)`.
- Remove the first element in `q`, once more than `size` elements are stored in `q`.
- Don't forget to update `sum_`.
- The result is the current `sum_` divided by the size of `q`.
